# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
Below are the contribution guidelines for smooth working of the project.

1. Before working on anything, open an issue.
2. Comment and/or assign yourself if you are solving the issue.
3. Submit a PR explaining changes. If this is a visual change, try to attach Old and New screenshots.
4. Tag everyone for comments.
